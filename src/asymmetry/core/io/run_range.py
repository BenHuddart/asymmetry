"""Resolve a contiguous run series to its files, bypassing the Open dialog.

The native Open dialog's File-name field truncates a long quoted list (~15
names / ~256 chars), so loading a contiguous run series (e.g. BiSCCO 1276–1289)
had to be split into batches by hand. :func:`resolve_run_range` expands a
folder plus an inclusive first/last run number into the sorted set of existing
files, so the GUI can load the whole series in one shot.

This is a pure, GUI-free filesystem helper: it only inspects names and existence
in one folder; it never opens or parses the data files.

    Scans ``folder`` (non-recursively) for files whose extension a loader
    claims — so sidecar logs (``.txt``/``.mon``) are ignored — parses the
    trailing digit group of each name as its run number, and returns the
    existing files whose run number falls in ``[first, last]``, sorted by run
    number. The match is padding-agnostic: ``MUSR00001276`` resolves to run
    ``1276`` regardless of zero-pad width.

    Parameters
    ----------
    folder : str or Path
        Directory holding the run files. Must exist and be a directory.
    first, last : int
        Inclusive run-number bounds. ``first`` must not exceed ``last``.
    prefix : str, optional
        Instrument/file prefix (e.g. ``"MUSR"``), matched case-insensitively
        against the leading text of each name. When *None*, the prefix is
        auto-detected from the files that fall in the range: exactly one
        prefix must be present, else a :class:`ValueError` lists the
        candidates so the caller can disambiguate.
    ext : str, optional
        Restrict the scan to a single extension (e.g. ``"nxs"`` or ``".nxs"``).
        When *None*, every loader-registered extension is considered.

    Returns
    -------
    list[pathlib.Path]
        Existing files in ``[first, last]``, sorted ascending by run number.
        **Gaps are skipped silently** — missing run numbers are simply absent,
        so a non-contiguous corpus yields the runs that do exist. An empty list
        means the folder held no matching runs in range (not an error).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``folder`` does not exist or is not a directory, if ``first > last``,
        or if ``prefix`` is *None* and the in-range files carry more than one
        distinct prefix.
